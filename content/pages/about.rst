Who am I ? (eng. Who are you ?)
-----------------------------------
Hi ! My name is Marcin Jabrzyk, I'm developer of embedded systems and Python. Interested especially in embedded Linux solutions. I'm passionate about open source, embedded systems, new technologies and a ton of other things.

I like to write software in Python, C, C++ and using Qt framework but I'm really not scared of touching hardware. I was co-organizer of SmartDevCon_ and PyConPL_. Currently I'm Master degree student in Computer Science at Silesian University of Technology.

I've started this site to share my thoughts, write about my projects and things that seems to be that intersting for me so I'll find time to write about them.
There are no topics defined but it'll mostly be about the things I like most so embedded systems, Python and Linux.
