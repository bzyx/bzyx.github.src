:summary: A short summary how I've moved from old blogging engine to a brand new cutting-edge technology, home site.

So finally I made my move and closed my old site on jogger_. I was just getting more and more spam comments and the social thing about jogger died completely.

It was the best time to move on.

I've changed my 'almost'-professional blog engine to a python based, static page generator called Pelican_ the theme is a Bootstrap_ 3 based theme with a Bootswatch_ custom css. I've found an interesting project on github which helped me to made the transition link_.

In my head I've thought myself that the site should be at most in English. Do I handle with that? Tough question. I attached a few from my old posts from jogger. These are the wise, funny, and interesting ones, feel free to laugh from them with me :)

Fingers crossed for my new project.

PS. The whole thing is hosted on github.io
