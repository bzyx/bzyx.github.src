:summary: Android is a popular operating system, based on Linux and developers of Linux based embedded systems are starting to see the use of Android in embedded applications, especially when the system must cooperate with human user. Today when i was looking over web I found an interesting resource...

If you are don't familiar of name Karim Yaghmour and you are interested in embedded systems, you should. He is the author of "`Building Embedded Linux Systems <http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529680.do>`_" . And today we are interested in his latest book "`Embedded Android <http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021094.do>`_"

So Karim is a CEO at `Opersys <http://www.opersys.com/>`_ where he also make trainings. The one which interested me, was  `Embedded Android Training <http://www.opersys.com/training/embedded-android#tab-courseware>`_ on the "Courseware" tab you can download the slides for the training sessions (I don't provide link cause it will probably change over the time).

I have also found Karim making a fast forward and simplified version of this course on Linaro Connect 2013. The videos are on YouTube thanks to Nicolas Charbonnier
from `ARMDevices.net <http://armdevices.net/>`_.

So here are the videos:

#1 - Android Internals 

.. youtube:: KLUXPxxJc5c


#2 - Working with the AOSP 

.. youtube:: LimC0XpeT0k


#3 - Native Android user-space 

.. youtube:: lHeMfFAFI-I


#4 - Using and Customizing the Android Framework 

.. youtube:: XwRy8Kv3vDQ

So it's easy to follow opening on half screen the browser with YouTube video and on the other half the pdf reader with the slides. You're welcome :)
